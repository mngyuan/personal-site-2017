It's finally done.

And by it, I mean me. I'm finally done with fiddling with bugs, wrestling with different tech stacks, and writing and rewriting. We've hit that sweet spot where most features are mostly bug free (that's a lie) and my motivation has waned (that one isn't).

It's not that I want to release crappy software, especially not on my personal site, but at this point I just want to write words, not code. The real reason I've been redoing this site is so that I have a place to blog. This site has some stuff I'm proud of, sure - the terminal, the github tracker, the homemade half-baked module system - but now I have thoughts to get out, and some of which I hope are worth hearing.

Here is where I'd tell you how much work this has been, and how proud of myself I am, and what struggles I faced and problems I've overcome, except that'd be boring. So instead here's some funny and heartbreaking commits from this repository that I think will get the same message across:

_Never a good sign when commits end with question marks._

_Uh, you okay there, me?_

_Sometimes you have to delete everything and start anew_

_The first thoughts of every SASS convert_

_Struggling with React Router_

_There isn't much worse than realizing the last few hundred lines you wrote were for naught_

_Ditched React Router and rolled my own_

_And here we are now._

"Finishing" this site marks the end of a couple months of coding block and a half year of engineering and over engineering, and with that comes the signature mix of pride and exhausted relief coding never fails to deliver.

I'll leave you all with this thought that popped into my head while writing this at my usual mental peak of well past midnight:

<p class='pullquote'><i>Never mistake the presence of words on a page for importance.</i></p>
